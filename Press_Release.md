Press Release

JupyterLab Commenting
---
 
**Teams can now comment on and annotate files within JupyterLab in real time.**
 
Real-time collaboration (RTC) is now a core part of JupyterLab. Communication is vital for effective RTC, but until now, has been unavailable within JupyterLab. The commenting extension gives users a voice with live comments, quick replies, and search and filter.
 
When working together on notebooks, collaborators often have recommendations and opinions about code and data. These recommendations have to be relayed outside JupyterLab, and it is hard to quickly convey exactly what needs to be changed and how--especially if the whole team isn’t using Git/GitHub. Without commenting and annotation, teams often find that JupyterLab doesn’t cut it for serious collaboration.
 
The JupyterLab Commenting extension streamlines communication and enables users to comment on almost anything, including cells, outputs, text selections, datasets, and images. Comments are in markdown and support in-line LaTeX, as well as custom tags that allow you to easily label, sort, and search your team’s comments. Once created, comments live in a collapsible side panel where they can be searched and filtered for easy access. Quick replies allow users to swiftly address concerns while keeping in touch with their team by supplying common responses that can be sent with a single click.
 
Commenting is easy, intuitive, and similar to other commenting systems users are familiar with. Simply highlight, right-click, and select “Add Comment” to comment on cells, text selections, and more. In addition, quick replies and non-intrusive notifications will help you seamlessly blend commenting into your existing workflow.  
 
*“Integrated commenting helped my team streamline our feedback process so we didn’t have to hold as many meetings. It also allowed me to collaborate with newer users that weren’t familiar with GitHub”* ~ Satisfied User
 
Don’t wait to collaborate! Open up new channels of communication with JupyterLab commenting.
